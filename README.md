## Genetic Algorithms

### DNA Inspired Structures

Genetics: Concentrates on the transmission of traits from parents to offspring.  This includes behavior traits such as temperament and intelligence.  These traits are stored in _chromosomes_.  Chromosomes contain a list of traits that are stored in a gene.  Evolutionary computing attempts to mimic this phenomenon through the use of computing.

Each trait is mapped to a binary array that represents a chromosome.  Each population is put through a test or series of tests and rated on some statistic such as speed, resources collected etc.  Once the test is run, some percentage of organisms are combined to create the next generation of testers.

One example of a genetic algorithm seen in nature is _camouflage_.  In nature, animals that are able to blend into their environment are able to avoid capture by predators more easily.  Over time, this causes the population of animal to fit their environment better.

In nature, _mutations_ sometimes occur which can either serve as a benefit or inhibitor to an organisms survivability.  This can be achieved in code by introducing a random chance to set a gene to a completely random value.

A _fitness test_ determines which set of the population survives and which set dies.
